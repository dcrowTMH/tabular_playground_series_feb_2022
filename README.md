Aimed to practice the workflow and skill for machine learning that I have learnt.

Objective for the competition:
Train the model with incompleted DNA sequences data & predict the target bacteria in test set

Current Progress: 16/02/2022 Finished processing data & create a template for further machine model training
Next milestone: Create another notebook from the template and work for different machine learning model and submitt to check with the performance
