# Machine learning skills practice
## Kaggle Competition - Tabular Playground Series Feb 2022
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-feb-2022/data

### Purpose for repository:

Aimed to practice the workflow and skill for machine learning that I have learnt.

### Objective for the competition:

Train the model with incompleted DNA sequences data & predict the target bacteria in test set

Current Progress: Competition End, get ready for next competition & learn from high score notebook

Just finished KNN part with quantile to deal with bias

Next milestone: Learn extra trees & GCD for other machine learning technique
